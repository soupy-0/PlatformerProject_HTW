- whole "Built Game" Folder is needed to start .exe file
- everything is done by myself except the assets, which were done by creators on Itch.io, whose names are:
adwitr, brullov, Ansimuz, Pixelnauta, BDragon1727, Free Game Assets(GUI, Sprite, Tilesets), Penusbmic, Senari Rey, ArksðŸ’¢, dani maccari, Pixelsnorf, Szadi art
Big Thank you to each of them, because I couldnt have focused on the Code without them taking over the Art!
